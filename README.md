# Fast and tiny: raytracing in python

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssloy/fast-and-tiny/main/result.png)

Who said that the code in this repository is fast **and** tiny? :)

Here are two versions: [tiny.py](https://github.com/ssloy/fast-and-tiny/blob/main/tiny.py) in 62 lines of code, very easy to read, but pretty slow. The other one, [fast.py](https://github.com/ssloy/fast-and-tiny/blob/main/fast.py) is a bit harder to read, but it is orders of magnitude faster.
